A string S containing only the letters "`A`", "`B`" and "`C`" is given. 
<br>The string can be transformed by removing one occurrence of  "`AA`", "`BB`" or "`CC`".

Transformation of the string is the process of removing letters from it, based on the rules described above. 
<br>As long as at least one rule can be applied, the process should be repeated. 
<br>If more than one rule can be used, any of them should be chosen.

Write a function:
```
string solution(string &S);
```
that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns any string that can result from a sequence of transformations as described above.

For example, given string S = "`ACCAABBC`" the function may return "`AC`", 
because one of the possible sequences of transformations is as follows:

---

Also, given string S = "`ABCBBCBA`" the function may return "` `", because one possible sequence of transformations is:

---

Finally, for string S = "`BABABA`" the function must return "`BABABA`", because 
no rules can be applied to string S.

Assume that:

- the length of S is within the range [0..50,000];
- string S consists only of the following characters: "`A`", "`B`" and/or "`C`".


Complexity:

- expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
- expected worst-case space complexity is O(N) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
